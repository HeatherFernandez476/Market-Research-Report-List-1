<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Metal Biliary Stent Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Covered Metal Biliary Stent</li><li>Uncovered Metal Biliary Stent</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The metal biliary stent market is segmented into two main types: covered metal biliary stents and uncovered metal biliary stents. Covered metal biliary stents are designed with a protective layer that reduces the risk of tissue ingrowth and occlusion, enhancing their longevity and effectiveness. Uncovered metal biliary stents, on the other hand, lack this outer layer, making them more prone to obstruction but often easier to remove. Both types are used to manage biliary obstructions, ensuring bile flow in patients with various conditions.</p></p>
