<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Cardiovascular Interventional Devices Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Coronary artery stent</li><li>PTCA balloon catheter</li><li>thread</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The cardiovascular interventional devices market comprises several key types. Coronary artery stents are mesh-like tubes implanted in narrowed arteries to maintain open blood flow. PTCA (Percutaneous Transluminal Coronary Angioplasty) balloon catheters are used to dilate obstructed coronary arteries by inflating a balloon at the blockage site. Additionally, the thread market involves guidewires that facilitate the navigation of catheters through the vasculature. Together, these devices play a crucial role in treating cardiovascular diseases efficiently and effectively.</p></p>
